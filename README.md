# Create Your Own Tote Bag

Create Your Own Tote Bag is an interactive command line program that aims to give peope a possibility to create their own tote bag out of reused material. The program iterates through a number of questions regarding fabrics and colors, and based on the user responses creates a unique tote bag, which is presented to the user at the end.

The tool is targeted towards people who are interested in sustainable solutions and design, and use their own bag when shopping or carrying things around. 

Create Your Own Tote Bag will come in handy for those who want a unique tote bag that they have designed themselves. The inspiration comes from my daughter's small business that sews tote bags from old spinnakers, scrap furnishing fabrics and old textile belts.

## UX

### User needs
As a user I would like a program that:
* Is easy to understand and use.
* Has an appealing layout.
* Saves the data in a spreadsheet, so it is possible to return to previous designs.
* Shows me the result at the end of the design process.
* Explains how I can return to a previous design.

### Owner goals
As a program owner, I would like to create a tool that:
* Creates a unique design for the user.
* Is easy to understand and use and has an appealing look.
* Validates the data to make sure the result is correct and easy to understand.
* Saves the data and can return the design to the user, both straight away and later.
