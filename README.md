# Create Your Own Tote Bag

Create Your Own Tote Bag aims to give peope a possibility to create their own tote bag out of reused material. The tool is targeted towards people who are interested in sustainable solutions and design, and use their own bag when shopping or carrying things around. 

Create Your Own Tote Bag will come in handy for those who want a unique tote bag that they have designed themselves. The idea for the tool is based on a small business that sows tote bags from old spinnakers, scrap furnishing fabrics and old textile belts.
